**Early Development Stage** - A TypeScript implementation of the DMTF Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI) 2.0 specification for building cloud platform APIs and infrastructure automation tools.

This library provides strongly-typed interfaces and abstract classes for the CIMI model, designed for developers building cloud management systems, virtual machine platforms, and infrastructure automation tools. Currently implements core resource types with ongoing development toward full CIMI 2.0 compliance.

## Intended Use Cases

This library is being developed for:
- **Cloud platform API development** (OpenStack, CloudStack, custom platforms)
- **Virtual machine management systems** 
- **Infrastructure automation and orchestration tools**
- **Multi-cloud management platforms**
- **Enterprise cloud APIs** requiring DMTF standard compliance
- **DevOps tooling** for compute resource management

## Current Status

**Early development** - Core foundation classes and machine resource models are implemented. The library provides a solid TypeScript foundation for CIMI-compliant cloud APIs, with active development expanding resource coverage.

## What's Implemented

- **Core base classes** - CIMI_Base, CIMI_Resource, CIMI_Collection foundation
- **Machine resource model** - Complete machine lifecycle operations and states  
- **Type-safe references** - Strongly-typed resource references and relationships
- **Resource metadata** - Capability discovery and resource introspection
- **Collection management** - Abstract collection classes for resource grouping
- **DMTF compliance** - Proper CIMI 2.0 operation URIs and serialization

## Architecture

Built with TypeScript strict mode and designed for:
- **Type safety** - Compile-time error prevention for cloud API development
- **CIMI specification compliance** - Follows DMTF standards for interoperability  
- **Extensible design** - Abstract base classes for platform-specific implementations
- **Modern development** - ES2024 target with full TypeScript tooling support

## Development Goals

- Complete CIMI 2.0 resource model implementation
- Production-ready cloud platform SDK
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Documentation and usage examples
- Integration patterns for popular cloud platforms

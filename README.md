# CIMI Model (TypeScript Implementation)


> **Early Development**: Only a minimal subset of resource classes are currently implemented. This project is under active development.
At this stage, the implementation includes only a minimal subset of the model and is under active development.

A **TypeScript adaptation of the Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI) model**, based on the [DMTF CIMI specification](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cimi).

This implementation provides a consistent, strongly-typed representation of the CIMI data model for use in modern TypeScript-based applications and services..

## Features

- **Fully typed CIMI resource definitions** - Complete type safety for cloud infrastructure data
- **DMTF CIMI 2.0 compliant** - Adheres to the official specification  
- **Extensible design** - Built for integration into cloud automation tools and APIs
- **Schema validation ready** - Structured for validation and API integration

## Goals

- Align with the CIMI 2.0 standard
- Provide reusable TypeScript interfaces and classes
- Enable seamless schema validation and API integration
- Support modern cloud automation workflows

## Usage

Import and use CIMI model classes in your TypeScript project to serialize/deserialize cloud infrastructure data, validate schemas, or build APIs conforming to CIMI standards.

## Status

>  **Early development** â€“ only a few resource classes are currently implemented.
